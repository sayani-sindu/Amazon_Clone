<b style="color:DeepPink;">DIET:</b>
<h2><pre>The Items that will help you are:<br>
1.Antioxidants:
          Many dermatologists believe that the major antioxidants (vitamin A, C, and E) can help decrease the risk of sun and other environmental damage by disarming wrinkle-causing "free radicals" --
   unstable molecules that damage cells.
2. Choose 'Smart' Fats:
	    Heart- and joint-friendly omega-3 fatty acids may be skin-friendly too. The omega-3s from fish may help to guard against sun damage, according to a few recent studies on fish oil supplements.
3. Eat Whole Foods:
          Wilma Bergseld, MD, head of clinical research in dermatology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, said in the Environmental Nutrition.
4.Oranges, lemons, strawberries, pineapple, broccoli and tomatoes. Antioxidants are another compound found in a variety of fruits and veggies.

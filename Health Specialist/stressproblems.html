<h3>Stress that's left unchecked can contribute to many health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and diabetes.</h3>
<h2><pre>
Stress is how we react when we feel under pressure or threatened. It usually happens when we are in a situation that we don't feel we can manage or control.
Sometimes, a small amount of stress can help us to complete tasks and feel more energised.
But stress can become a problem when it lasts for a long time or is very intense.
In some cases, stress can affect our physical and mental health.
1.Acute stress happens within a few minutes to a few hours.
